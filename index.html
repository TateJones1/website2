    <p><img src="SPRIGA.jpg">This elegant little pokemon is a new Generation 9 starter, along with Quaxly and Fuecoco. However, this one is has something to offer that others don't. CUTENESS!!!!</p>
    <p><img src="CUTIE.jpg"> It evolves into Floragato at level 16, then into Meowscarada at level 36. Making it a dark and grass type after the final evolution.</p>
    <p><img src="CAT POKEMON.jpg"> In my humble opinion, I really think this is the best Cat pokemon. Only because it looks identical to my cat.</p>
